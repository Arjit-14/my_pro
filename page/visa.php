                Obtaining a Visa Support Letter from ICSCPS-2024 Conference will not guarantee that your India visa application will be approved. The letter is merely supplementary information that explains a visa applicant's intended purpose of travel to India.<br>
                <strong>For security purposes, the conference has policy for issuing official Visa Support Letters as follows:</strong>
            <ul class="mt-1" style="list-style-type: circle; list-style: square outside none;">
                <li>Visa Support Letters will be issued only after you have successfully registered and paid for your conference.</li>
                <li>Visa Support Letters can only be issued for the person registered to attend the conference in form of participant, author, chair and speaker.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately we cannot issue visa Support Letters for guests of participants.</li>

            </ul>
