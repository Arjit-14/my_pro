                    <strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br>
                    The review process of the conference will be strictly confidential. The practice of keeping all information confidential during the review is part of the standard communication at ICSCPS. Misuse of confidential information is a severe professional failure, and appropriate measures will be taken when brought to the attention of the Conference Organizers. It should be noted that the Conference Organizers will not be responsible for the consequences when reviewers break confidentiality.<br><br>

                    <strong>Review Process:</strong><br>
                    By submitting a paper to the conference, the authors agree to our single blind review process and understand that papers will be peer-reviewed by our expert reviewers after checking of plagiarism from a plagiarism checking software (preferably “Turnitin”). Authors are required to submit the revised version of the manuscript as per the review comments mentioned in the acceptance E-mail. Authors may be asked to undergo further revision(s) to their manuscript before final publication even after Conference.<br><br>

                    <strong>Plagiarism:</strong><br>
                    ICSCPS-2024 respects Intellectual Property Rights. Plagiarism consists of the wrong appropriation of someone’s content, thoughts, ideas by representing as one’s original work. This type of violation of ethical principles will not be entertained by the conference at any cost. It should be noted that papers having more than 18% similarity will not be processed, hence they will be summarily rejected. For a single source, the similarity index should not be greater than 2%.<br><br>

                    <strong>Dual/ Double Submissions:</strong><br>
                    The goals of our conference are to publish exciting new work for the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers. By submitting a manuscript to the conference, the authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent. Any submission to the conference should not overlap with prior publications or other concurrent submissions. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to the conference, the authors should cite these papers, argue in the body of your paper why your paper is non-trivially different from these concurrent submissions, and include those papers in the supplemental material. Authors are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs for any clarifications.<br><br>

                    <strong>Attendance responsibilities:</strong><br>
                    The authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper there. Acceptance of a paper does not claim for final publication. Only presented papers will be forwarded to the publication partner. Presenters will be provided a certificate of paper presentation.<br><br>

                    <strong>Publication:</strong><br>
                    All accepted and presented papers will be submitted for publication to our publication partner (preferably in SCOPUS-indexed proceedings). Before final publication, the publication partner may send the proofs to the corresponding author. Make sure the email id of the corresponding author is correctly mentioned in the manuscript. Keep visiting the conference website for more updates regarding publication details.<br>
