                            This conference aims to allow participants to discuss the recent developments in the field of Mathematical Sciences faced by the community in the 21st century. This conference is a premier platform for the researcher to show their research and get comments from the experts of almost all around the globe. The conference consists of invited oral presentations. This
                            conference is necessarily for popularisation and extension of Research and Development in Mathematical Science and allied fields. To ensure an intense interaction amongst the
                            researchers present at the conference, only a single session will be in progress at any given time for a specific thing. The conference offers UG students an opportunity to present their research as a poster to foster research in the early years of&nbsp;academic&nbsp;study.

                            CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational vision of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an educationalist and social reformer of the nineteenth century in South India. He founded the first Catholic indigenous congregation, Carmelites of Mary Immaculate
                            (CMI), in 1831, which administers CHRIST (Deemed to be University). CHRIST was established on 15 July 1969 as an affiliated college, with the Vision of 'Excellence and Service'. It became a preferred educational institution in Bangalore, Delhi-NCR and Lavasa within
                            the short period of inception. One of the first institutions in India to be accredited in 1998 by the NAAC, and subsequently in 2004 and 2016, CHRIST (Deemed to be University) has the top grade ‘A’ in the 4-point scale.
                            <br>
                            Today, the University offers many Undergraduate, Postgraduate and PhD Programmes in Humanities, Social Sciences, Science, Commerce, Management, Engineering, Education, Law, and Architecture to over 24000 students from all the states of
                            India and about 60 different countries. In 2019, CHRIST (Deemed to be University) completed 50 glorious years of its existence and sterling contribution to the cause of higher education in India.
